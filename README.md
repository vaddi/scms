## Usage ##

Simply editing the config.php File to fit you needs. Important Settings are BASE, MAIL, SITE_OWNER ,SITE_PASSWD, SQL-Data. 


## Idea ##

Based on a small Website for a Friend we buld up the Base in a few Days. Later we decide to use the System oftener and bring it up to others because, its just simple. Beside the maincoding the Idea grown up by more and more Features:

*  All Pages will viewed in one Menu (No Submenu at the Time) 
*  All Content are stored in Database
*  Content use Simple Templates 
*  Have to be very userfriendly by simple Structure and Usage


## On Going ##

Would be nice to have:

*  Plugin-Engine 
*  Submenu for Subpages 
*  CRUD functions for pages and newsfiles.
*  handheld & mobile CSS File
